Is there a way to version ~/.bashrc in-place by git, without copying to a different repo?

You can create a repo in another directory, and then use a symbolic link in your home directory (~) to point to the new file.

mkdir -p ~/path/to/repo
mv ~/.bashrc ~/path/to/repo/

cd ~
ln -s ~/path/to/repo/.bashrc .bashrc

cd ~/path/to/repo
# edit .bashrc
git init
git add .bashrc
git commit -m "Initial commit"

This way, you have a plain repository that contains only the files you want to version control, and the rest of your system uses ~/.bashrc as before, transparently following the link to the version controlled file. No .gitignore or shell aliases needed.
